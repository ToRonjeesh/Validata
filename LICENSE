### Final Steps

1. Commit all files to your GitHub repository.
2. You can now install the package with pip from the repository or by building a wheel:
   - Local install: `pip install -e .`
   - Build a distribution:  
     ```bash
     python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
     pip install dist/data_validator-0.1.0.tar.gz
     ```

This package is now ready to be used as a custom library. Users can import the key functions from `data_validator` (such as `validate_df`, `validate_join`, `safe_join`, and `test_notebook_dataframes`) in their projects.
